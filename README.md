# GPS-Tracker
This project started with the question "Why buy something when you can build it?" and apparently I was able to make a GPS tracker myself. So, not only I saved some money but I also learned a lot throughout the development process. Working: As soon as some movement is detected the tracker starts uploading the GPS coordinates on ThingSpeak cloud as well as send them through SMS to the designated phone number. To save on the power consumption the tracker remains in the sleep mode when not in use. Components used: Arduino UNO, GSM900A, NEO-6M GPS module, Piezo Transducer.
